# Music-recommendation-System Using Spotify API
This project provides a Python script for extracting detailed music data from Spotify playlists using the Spotipy library. It offers functionalities like:

Retrieve track information (name, artists, album details, ID, popularity)
Optionally fetch audio features (danceability, energy, key, etc.) for deeper analysis
Organize extracted data in a pandas DataFrame for easy manipulation and analysis
Getting Started:

## Prerequisites:

Python 3.x
Spotipy library (pip install spotipy)
Pandas library (pip install pandas)

## Spotify Access Token:

Create a developer account on Spotify: https://developer.spotify.com/
Obtain your Client ID and Client Secret
Use these credentials to generate an access token through a process like the one outlined here: https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/concepts/access-token (Important: Do not share your Client Secret publicly!)

## Using the Script:

Clone or download this repository.
Replace the client Id and client secret with your own
Get the playlist data
Build a music recommendation system based on the collected data (consider privacy implications)
